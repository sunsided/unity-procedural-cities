# Procedural Cities

A procedural house/city generator as described in the [Build a System that Generates Houses & Castles](https://www.udemy.com/course/unity-5-build-a-system-that-generates-houses-castles-auto) Udemy course.

So far, the following is implemented:

- 3D grid sampling for starting positions,
- Disconnected component suppression to encourage "bigger" houses
- Randomized prefabs instantiation for
  - Regular walls,
  - Walls with doors on the ground floor, and
  - Rooftops,
  - Windows,
- Shared wall removal.
